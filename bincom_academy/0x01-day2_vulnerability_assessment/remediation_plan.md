# **Vulnerability Remediation Plan for DVWA**

**Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Author:** Ikwuka Okoye
**Scope:** DVWA web application vulnerabilities identified via OpenVAS scan and Metasploit exploit.

## **Executive Summary:**  
Scan revealed 15+ vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, Command Injection). Exploited Command Injection allowed code execution. Remediate by input validation, updates, and security controls.

## **Identified Vulnerabilities (Top 3):**  
1. Command Injection (CVSS 9.8, High): Allows arbitrary OS commands.  
2. SQL Injection (CVSS 8.6, High): Database manipulation.  
3. XSS (CVSS 6.1, Medium): Script injection.

### **Remediation Steps:**  
1. **Input Sanitization:**  
   - Use PHP functions like `escapeshellarg()` for command inputs.  
   - For SQL: Switch to prepared statements (PDO/MySQLi).  
   - Timeline: Immediate code changes.

2. **Update and Patch:**  
   - Upgrade PHP to 8.3+ (as of 2026).  
   - Apply OWASP best practices: Filter inputs, escape outputs.  
   - Install WAF (ModSecurity) to block patterns.

3. **Configuration Hardening:**  
   - Set DVWA security to "High".  
   - Enable CSP headers in Apache: `Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'"`.  
   - Least privilege: Run Apache as non-root, restrict file permissions.

4. **Monitoring and Testing:**  
   - Rescan with OpenVAS post-fixes.  
   - Implement logging (e.g., fail2ban for brute-force).  
   - Risk Assessment: Reduce CVSS by 50% with fixes.

**Verification:**  
- Re-exploit attempt should fail.  
- Follow-up scan report showing resolved issues.
