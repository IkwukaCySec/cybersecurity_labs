# GVM/OpenVAS Scan

On Kali, setup OpenVAS (Kali has GVM):

`sudo gvm-setup`

Follow prompts, access web UI, scan DVWA IP.

## GVM/OpenVAS Discontinuation

Since I have been running into repeated setup and startup problems with GVM/OpenVAS (PostgreSQL version/port conflicts, ospd-openvas failures, distutils/Python issues, service timeouts, etc.), it's reasonable to switch to a much simpler alternative for the Day 2 assignment.

The curriculum lists Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto, Metasploit as example tools, so one can use a different scanner for the vulnerability scan part while still meeting the objective.

## New Alternative(s)

Easiest Alternatives:
- Nikto + Nmap --script vuln (or Nmap + vulners.nse) for scanning
