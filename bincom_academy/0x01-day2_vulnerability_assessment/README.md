# Day 2: Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation Lab  
**Bincom Academy Cybersecurity Curriculum**

## Overview

This repository documents the completion of **Assignment 2** from Day 2 of the Bincom Academy Cybersecurity Curriculum (Version 1.1, updated 27/10/2025).

**Objective**:  
- Set up and configure **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** in an isolated lab.  
- Perform a comprehensive vulnerability scan using **OpenVAS** (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager / GVM).  
- Exploit at least one identified vulnerability using **Metasploit**.  
- Develop and document a practical remediation plan.

**Key Tools Used**:
- Kali Linux (attacker / scanner VM)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (target VM with LAMP + DVWA)
- OpenVAS / GVM (vulnerability scanning)
- Metasploit Framework (exploitation)
- Browser (for DVWA interaction and verification)

**Curriculum Learning Outcomes**:
- Understanding CVE identifiers and CVSS scoring
- Vulnerability scanning workflow
- Controlled exploitation of common web vulnerabilities
- Writing structured remediation recommendations

## ⚠️ Important Warnings & Ethics

- **Isolated environment only** — All activities were performed in a fully isolated VirtualBox/VMware host-only network.  
- No production systems, public IPs, or unauthorized targets were touched.  
- This lab simulates real-world vulnerabilities **for educational purposes only**.  
- Follow responsible disclosure and ethical hacking principles at all times.  
- AWS / cloud resources are **not** used in this assignment (see Day 5 for cloud labs).

## Lab Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- VirtualBox or VMware Workstation/Player
- Kali Linux VM (latest 2026 release recommended)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS VM (target)
- Host-only network (e.g., 192.168.56.0/24)
- ≥16 GB RAM and 100 GB free disk on host recommended

### Network Diagram (Simplified)
Host Machine
├─ Kali Linux (Attacker)     → 192.168.56.101
└─ Ubuntu Target (DVWA)      → 192.168.56.102
(Host-Only Adapter)


### Step-by-Step Setup Commands

**On Target VM (Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install apache2 mariadb-server php php-mysqli php-gd libapache2-mod-php -y
sudo mysql_secure_installation

# Create DVWA database and user
sudo mysql -u root -p
# Inside MySQL:
CREATE DATABASE dvwa;
CREATE USER 'dvwa'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'p@ssw0rd';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dvwa.* TO 'dvwa'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

# Install DVWA
sudo git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.git /var/www/html/dvwa
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/dvwa/
cd /var/www/html/dvwa/config
sudo cp config.inc.php.dist config.inc.php
# Edit config.inc.php → set db_user, db_password, etc.

sudo systemctl restart apache2

Access setup: http://192.168.56.102/dvwa/setup.php → Create/Reset Database
Login: admin / password → Set security level to Low

**On Kali VM:**
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gvm metasploit-framework -y
sudo gvm-setup          # Takes ~15-30 min; note generated admin password
sudo gvm-start
# Access OpenVAS UI: https://127.0.0.1:9392

**Key Evidence (included):**

- DVWA dashboard after successful setup
- OpenVAS scan configuration and full report (high/medium findings highlighted)
- Metasploit exploit run → reverse shell / command execution proof
- Remediation plan covering input validation, prepared statements, WAF, patching, etc.

### Walkthrough Summary

**DVWA Deployment** → Installed on LAMP stack, reset DB, logged in, security = Low
**Vulnerability Scanning** → Configured GVM target & task, ran full scan (~15–30 min)
→ Discovered: Command Injection, SQL Injection, XSS, weak configs (CVSS 6.1–9.8)
**Exploitation** → Used Metasploit to exploit Command Injection vulnerability
→ Obtained reverse shell as www-data
**Remediation** → Documented fixes: sanitization, prepared statements, CSP headers, least privilege, WAF rules

### Lessons Learned

- Many production web apps suffer from the same issues as DVWA when input is not properly sanitized.
- Vulnerability scanners like OpenVAS are excellent for discovery but require manual validation.
- Exploitation frameworks like Metasploit dramatically reduce time-to-exploit for known patterns.
- Remediation is often more time-consuming (and important) than exploitation.
