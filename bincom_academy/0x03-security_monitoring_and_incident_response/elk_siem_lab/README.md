# Elk

The docker-compose.yml file is the main file for the creation of Elk/Kibana image to complete this task, but we are being faced by an immense challenge.

## The Challenge(s)

The creation of the images use to stop half-way. And the size of the image to be created is a bit huge like Security Onion (SO) VM.

Downloading Security Onion (SO) would have been the best way to complete this task, but its huge size, and special computer  hardware and software requirements are major drawbacks that made it impossible for us to have it downloaded.

The Day 4 Task is not hard on its own, but getting the required softwares dowbloaded and kept in order is the demanding challenge that needs to be addressed.
