# AIG Shields Up: Cybersecurity Job Simulation (Forage)

## 🔐 Overview
This repository contains my work and documentation from the **AIG Shields Up: Cybersecurity** job simulation on **Forage** — a free, self-paced virtual experience program that simulates real-world cybersecurity tasks as performed by an Information Security Analyst at **(AIG ShieldsUp Cybersecurity)[https://www.theforage.com/simulations/aig/cybersecurity-ku1i]**

Through this simulation, I gained hands-on experience in **vulnerability analysis**, **risk communication**, **incident response**, **Python scripting for security tasks**, and **stakeholder communication** — all critical skills for careers in cybersecurity operations and analysis.

---

## 🎯 Program Objectives

The simulation is structured around two core tasks:

**1. Responding to a Zero-Day Vulnerability**  
- Research a real-world vulnerability (Apache Log4j) using CISA advisories.  
- Analyze its potential impact on company infrastructure.  
- Draft a professional advisory to internal stakeholders explaining the issue and remediation steps. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

**2. Ransomware Response & Python Scripting**  
- Simulate a ransomware incident where a critical server’s data is compromised.  
- Develop and run a Python script to attempt recovery of encrypted data without paying ransom — demonstrating basic defensive scripting and problem-solving. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## 🧠 Skills Developed

- **Cyber Vulnerability Research & Analysis**  
  Evaluated official advisories and assessed exploit risk.

- **Technical & Non-Technical Communication**  
  Drafted clear, actionable advisories to non-technical teams.

- **Incident Response Fundamentals**  
  Applied structured thinking to mitigate ransomware impact.

- **Python Programming for Security**  
  Built automation scripts simulating ethical recovery techniques.

- **Risk Prioritization & Reporting**  
  Interpreted threat severity and proposed remediation strategies.

- **Business-Aligned Security Judgement**  
  Balanced technical findings with business impact considerations.

## 📄 Task Summaries

### 📌 Task 1 — Zero-Day Vulnerability Response

As part of my role, I:

1. Reviewed official cybersecurity alerts from the **Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)** and related agencies about the Apache Log4j vulnerability. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
2. Researched details about the vulnerability’s mechanism and impact (remote code execution flaw). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
3. Identified affected systems in the simulated AIG Product Development Staging Environment.  
4. Drafted and refined a professional advisory email to internal engineering teams detailing:
   - Vulnerability description  
   - Risks and business impact  
   - Recommended mitigation and remediation steps  

This task tested my ability to turn **technical threat intelligence** into **clear, actionable business guidance**.

### 📌 Task 2 — Ransomware & Python Scripting

In the second part, a simulated ransomware attack affected a production server where:

- Only one encrypted ZIP file remained after containment.  
- Paying ransom was not an option, so I wrote a **Python script** to attempt a brute-force recovery using a wordlist. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

This exercise strengthened my understanding of:

- Ethical defensive scripting  
- Iterative automation in incident scenarios  
- Integrating programming logic into security problem solving

## 📈 Career Relevance

This job simulation supports readiness for roles including:

- **Cybersecurity Analyst**  
- **Incident Response Analyst**  
- **SOC Analyst (Security Operations Center)**  
- **Threat & Vulnerability Analyst**  
- **Risk & Compliance Specialist**

It aligns with core blue-team competencies: *risk detection → analysis → communication → mitigation*. **(Shields Up: Cybersecurity)[https://www.theforage.com/simulations/aig/cybersecurity-ku1i]**
