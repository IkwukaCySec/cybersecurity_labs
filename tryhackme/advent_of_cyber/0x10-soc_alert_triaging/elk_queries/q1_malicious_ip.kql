# Question 1 Equivalent: Malicious external IP (most outbound connections)
# KQL filter + aggregation in Discover or Dashboard
destination.ip: NOT (10.0.0.0/8 OR 172.16.0.0/12 OR 192.168.0.0/16)
# Then add aggregation: Terms on destination.ip, sort by count descending
# Top result = malicious IP (e.g., 185.99.135.142)
