# Malware Analysis Report — Malhare.hta (AoC 2025 Day 21)

**Sample:** Malhare.hta – HTA Dropper  
**Classification:** CONFIDENTIAL // Threat Research  
**Analyst:** Ikwuka Okoye – Senior Malware Reverse Engineer  
**Date:** January 4, 2026

## Executive Summary
Detailed analysis of a malicious HTML Application (HTA) file distributed via phishing as "Best Festival Company Developer Survey". The sample employs heavy JavaScript obfuscation to evade detection while executing secondary payloads via `mshta.exe`.

**Key Findings**
- Social Engineering Lure: Fake developer salary survey
- Execution Vector: Direct HTA execution (`mshta.exe survey.hta`)
- Obfuscation: Multi-layer eval() + String.fromCharCode()
- Persistence: Startup folder placement
- Payload Delivery: Downloads and executes Malhare.exe

**Detection Status:** High-confidence signatures developed (YARA, Sigma)

## Technical Artifacts
- `walkthrough.md` – Complete static & dynamic analysis
- `/sample/` – Original HTA file
- `/static_analysis/` – Deobfuscated code and string extracts
- `/dynamic_analysis/` – Behavioral capture and timeline
- `/detection/` – Deployable detection rules
- `/tools/` – Custom analysis automation
- `/report/` – Executive and technical reporting

## Indicators of Compromise
- File Name: survey.hta
- Window Title: "Best Festival Company Developer Survey"
- Process: mshta.exe with .hta argument
- Network: Outbound to suspicious survey domains

**Mitigation Status:** Rules deployed | Monitoring active
