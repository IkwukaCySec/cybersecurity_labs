# cURL Exploitation — Curl of Duty (AoC 2025 Day 22)

**TryHackMe Room:** cURL Exploitation (Advent of Cyber 2025 - Day 22)  
**Skills Demonstrated:** Command Injection | Blind RCE | Out-of-Band (OOB) Exfiltration | DNS Tunneling | Reverse Shell Delivery | Burp Suite | Web Application Penetration Testing  

## **Professional Summary**
Conducted advanced exploitation of a blind command injection vulnerability in a web application using the `curl` binary. Demonstrated full attack chain:
- Confirmed injection point via time-based delays
- Exfiltrated sensitive data using DNS OOB techniques
- Achieved remote code execution and reverse shell

**Key Achievements**
- Successfully exfiltrated flag via blind DNS tunneling
- Delivered stabilized reverse shell using cURL one-liners
- Developed automated payload generator and local testing lab
- Created detection rules (Sigma) for defensive monitoring

## Tools & Techniques
- Burp Suite (Repeater/Intruder)
- cURL command injection payloads
- DNS exfiltration (collaborator/oob server)
- Python automation for payload generation
- Flask-based vulnerable app for local reproduction
